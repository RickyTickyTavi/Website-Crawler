# README 

This is README.md. 

This is for project level documentation within GitLab. While the project is getting kicked off, we can organize the different components of the project here. I think it would be a good idea for everyone to edit this file locally and push a commit early so we can make sure that our setups are all working. 


[Agile Board](https://issues350.cs.odu.edu/projects/tangerine2summer/agile/board)

This is our Agile board. We use it to track the progress of individual user stories from interface design (think the skeletons classes from the JUnit assignments) through unit tests, implementation, and completion. 

[Design Wiki](https://forge350.cs.odu.edu/bklarman/Tangerine2/wikis/design) 

This is where we are collaborating on our design. It's got details and instructions initially, but we're going to delete that and replace it with design notes, UML descriptions, etc.
